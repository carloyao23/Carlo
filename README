	<p style="font-size:25;color:pink">New roles<BR></P>
	<P style="font-size:25;color:pink">Now that i'm in college i now have more Roles in life, one example is that  i must study harder than i did when i was in high school. <BR> I don't want to waste what my parents give to me like the tuition for my course. i know that my course is hard but still i'll do everything just to make my parents happy. I want to be a successful in my course. </P><BR>

	<p style="font-size:25; color: Red">New routines</B></BR>
	My first impression of college life was that it is quite similar to high school. I thought, perhaps, it would be a whole lot of fun and not a bit stressful. After all it has always been the way I generally presume life to be â€“ simple and fun. After a week, however, I doubt that I could ever tell myself to remain carefree about my studies and all those other things. Now it becomes clear to me that I have to work hard if ever I wish to receive that coveted diploma, which indeed I do intend to.<BR>

	<p style="font-size:25 ; color:Yellow">New relationship</P>

	<p style="font-size:25 ; color: violet"> Well i think i'll continue being kind and friendly to my new classmate but in our first day it's not hard to approach them. Our class i think is the best of all because we all cooperate and share things. We also always have fun. So i think i'll do the same like how I treat my friends in high school.</P>



	<p style=" font-size: 25;color:cyan">New assumptions</p>

	<p style="font-size: 25; color:red"> I guess it is time to change my daily routines so to speak. No more excessive gaming or internet usage and more of studying and advanced reading. It is no joke being in college, you can barely catch up with the life if you do not start being a diligent fellow. Hence I tell myself it is time to throw away all those nasty habits and bring on a new phase of industry.
